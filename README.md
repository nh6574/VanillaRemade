# VanillaRemade - Reference Balatro Mod

Remakes vanilla objects using SMODS and simple hooks. Meant to serve as a Balatro modding example.

This is not meant to be a tutorial or explained example mod like [these ones](https://github.com/Steamodded/examples/) nor is it meant to be used for playing but rather as a reference point for your own mod effects.

Please make sure to check the [SMODS documentation](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) and [VanillaRemade wiki](https://github.com/nh6574/VanillaRemade/wiki) as well for more information and guides.

As much of the code is inspired by Balatro's own code, this repository doesn't include a license.

Please report any issues to <https://github.com/nh6574/VanillaRemade/issues>, thanks.
